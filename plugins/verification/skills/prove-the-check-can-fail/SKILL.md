  Use when adding or relying on a test, assertion, screenshot golden, lint rule or CI
  step meant to catch something, before trusting it or reporting it as coverage. Also
  fire when wiring a check into CI, when a check passes on its first run having never
  been seen red, or when the user asks "does that actually test anything" / "is that
  really covered". Do NOT fire for test-driven work, where the test was already seen
  failing before the fix.

# Prove the check can fail

A green check is not evidence until it has been seen red: passing proves it ran, only
failing proves it was looking at the right thing. A check that cannot fail is worse
than no check, because it gets reported as coverage.

Complements `superpowers:verification-before-completion` — that skill asks "did the
command pass?", this one asks "would it have caught the bug?".

## Procedure

1. **Name the defect.** One sentence: what wrong state does this check exist to
   catch? If that cannot be stated, the check has no purpose yet — fix that first.

2. **Introduce the defect.** The smallest edit that produces it: corrupt the golden,
   invert the condition, delete the guard, remove the `await`. Prefer a temporary
   edit you can revert exactly: `cp <file> "$TMPDIR/orig"` first, restore with
   `cp "$TMPDIR/orig" <file>`. Never `git checkout <file>` — that also discards any
   uncommitted work the file already had.

3. **Run the check the way CI runs it.** Same task, same flags — lifted from the
   workflow YAML or pipeline config, not reconstructed from memory. Then read the
   output.
   - **Still green → suspect the check is inert.** Before concluding, rule out the
     innocent causes: a cached pass (next bullet), a task name, filter or file
     pattern that never selected the check, and a mutated file the run does not
     read — compare the reported test count for a test; for a lint or scan step,
     compare the files-scanned count or echo the input list. Only when those hold
     is the check inert. Stop there: that finding matters more than whatever you
     were originally doing.
   - **Suspiciously fast → suspect caching.** A build tool reporting success in under
     a second usually skipped the work. Re-run with `--rerun-tasks` (Gradle),
     `--no-cache` (jest), a preceding `cargo clean` (cargo has no force flag) or
     the equivalent. **A cached pass is not a pass**, and a cached pass during
     this step invalidates the whole experiment.
   - Confirm the failure message actually names the defect you introduced. A check
     failing for an unrelated reason has still not been validated.

4. **Restore and re-run.** Confirm green from the restored state, not from cache.
   Verify the working tree is back to where it started: `cmp "$TMPDIR/orig" <file>`
   and `git status`.

5. **Report both halves.** "Fails when broken, passes when fixed", with the failure
   message quoted.

## Sharp edges

- **A check can pass against nothing at all.** Some frameworks only assert when
  driven by their own runner — screenshot libraries are the classic case, where
  the ordinary test task captures nothing and passes regardless — and a test
  asserting on pixels, layout or graphics passes the same way against a stub that
  draws nothing. Introduce a visible defect; if the check does not notice, it was
  never looking.
- **Generated artifacts get regenerated.** If the check reads something a generator
  produces (an installed hook, a rendered config, a build output), degrade the
  *generator*. Degrading the artifact proves nothing: a setup step or an
  earlier-ordered test rebuilds it, and the check goes green against the repaired
  copy. Have the check produce what it asserts on, so it cannot pass on a stale one.
- **CI ≠ local.** If the check is meant to guard CI, prove it fails *in the CI
  invocation*, not just in a local one-off command.
- **A check that shares its rule with what it checks proves nothing.** A scan that
  confirms a regex by running that regex counts its own false positives as
  confirmations. Validate with a DIFFERENT rule — the near-miss it must not match,
  or the side you did not count.
- **Mutate every SHAPE the check's matcher can meet, not one instance of one
  shape.** A check that recognises its subject by pattern is only proved against
  the patterns you fed it, and the ones you skip are exactly where it is blind.
  A CI guard comparing two lists of command-line flags was proved by changing a
  flag that takes a value, went red, and shipped; its matcher required an `=`, so
  every valueless flag in the same list — `--verify`, `--merge` — drifted past it
  reporting a match. One mutation per shape the pattern admits: with a value and
  without, at the start of a line and mid-line, quoted and bare.
- **Delete ONE occurrence, not all.** A rule stated twice by design — a policy's
  `USING` and its `WITH CHECK`, a value repeated per environment, a guard in both
  branches of a fork — survives a presence assertion (`toContain`, `grep -q`)
  when either half is removed, so the mutation that should go red stays green.
  Assert the COUNT, then mutate each occurrence in turn. The halves usually do
  different work: an admin who cannot edit their own row under `USING` but whose
  `WITH CHECK` forgot to say so can still write one.
- **A run that read nothing reports perfectly.** Over an empty input set every
  assertion holds — 0 failures, all green, indistinguishable from a clean run.
  Assert on the INPUT count (files opened, rows read) before believing the result:
  a partial run produces a believable figure and gets quoted.

## When to STOP

- **Test-driven work** — the test was already seen failing; do not redo it.
- **Breaking it is unsafe or irreversible** (production data, a live migration, a
  destructive deploy). Reason it through instead, and say plainly in the report that
  the check was not empirically falsified.
- **Third-party check with a documented, trusted failure mode** — point at the
  documentation rather than staging a failure.
- **The defect cannot be introduced without a large rewrite.** Say so; that itself
  suggests the check is coupled to something it should not be.
