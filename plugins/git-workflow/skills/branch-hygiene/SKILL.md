  Use when a PR has just merged on `origin/develop` or `origin/main`, when multiple open
  PRs share an ancestor that has now landed, when the user says "rebase the open PRs" /
  "manage open PRs" / "PR X merged, clean up" / "fix conflicts" / "deal with conflicting
  PRs", **before merging a PR that another open PR is based on**, or after
  running `gh pr merge`. Goal — drop duplicate commits introduced by the
  merge, force-push the open PRs onto the new base, prune dead worktrees and branches,
  and close the issues the merged PR's keywords could not. Do NOT fire for
  deliberate history surgery on one PR (dropping, reordering or splitting
  commits is `rewrite-pr-history`) or for promoting an integration branch to the
  branch people install from (`close-the-release-cycle`).

# Post-merge branch hygiene

After any merge to `develop` / `main`, the other open PRs that branched from the merged work appear `CONFLICTING` on GitHub because the merge commit assigned new SHAs to commits whose patches are now in the base. Resolution is mechanical: rebase + force-push.

## Before you merge a PR others are based on

Merging is where a stack is lost, and both failure modes look like the tool
helping.

1. **Find the children, and retarget them FIRST**:

   ```bash
   gh pr list --base <branch-about-to-merge> --json number,headRefName
   gh pr edit <n> --base <the parent's own base>      # BEFORE the merge
   ```

   Merging the parent does **not** retarget a child — it leaves it running its
   checks against a branch nobody will push to again. Deleting the parent's
   branch does not retarget it either: it **closes** it. And a closed PR can be
   neither retargeted (`Cannot change the base branch of a closed pull request`)
   nor reopened once its base branch is gone, so the only recovery is a new PR
   from the same branch — the review history stays behind on the closed one.

2. **Remove the worktree holding the branch**, or `--delete-branch` fails with
   `cannot delete branch '<x>' used by worktree at …` and the merge lands with
   the branch still there — which is the state that leaves a child stranded.

   ```bash
   git worktree remove <path> && gh pr merge <parent> --squash --delete-branch
   ```

3. **Then rebase each child** onto the new base, per the procedure below.

## Procedure

1. **Sync remote state**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin --prune
   ```

2. **List open PRs**:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
   ```

3. **For each open PR where** `mergeable=CONFLICTING` **or** `mergeStateStatus` is
   `DIRTY` / `BEHIND`. Not `BLOCKED` or `UNSTABLE` — those mean a red check or a
   missing review, which a rebase does not fix and a force-push only reruns:

   a. Pick the worktree to work in — call it `$wt`:
   ```bash
   git worktree list                  # find any path already on <branch>
   git -C <path> status --porcelain   # empty → reuse it as $wt
   ```
   No worktree holds the branch → add a temp one, which step 4 removes again:
   ```bash
   git worktree add /tmp/rebase-pr-<n> <branch>
   ```
   A worktree holds it but is **dirty** → skip this PR and say so; `git worktree
   add` refuses a branch already checked out, and forcing it races two worktrees
   over a branch you are about to force-push.

   Every command in the rest of step 3 runs against `$wt`.

   b. Rebase onto the PR's new base — **which of the two forms depends on how
   the parent landed**:

   ```bash
   # Parent was MERGED (a merge commit): its commits are ancestors of the base,
   # so a plain rebase recognises and skips the duplicates.
   git -C "$wt" rebase origin/<base-branch>
   ```
   Git auto-skips commits whose patches are already on the base (the duplicate ones). Watch the `warning: skipped previously applied commit <sha>` lines — those confirm the cleanup.

   ```bash
   # Parent was SQUASH-merged: its commits are NOT ancestors of anything, so the
   # plain form replays this PR's work onto changes it already contains and
   # conflicts on every hunk. Replay only this PR's own commits instead.
   git -C "$wt" rebase --onto origin/<base-branch> <parent-branch-tip-sha> <branch>
   ```
   `<parent-branch-tip-sha>` is where this PR forked — the parent's last commit,
   which `git log --oneline <branch>` still shows even after the parent branch is
   deleted. Get it by counting your own commits back from the tip:

   ```bash
   n=$(gh pr view <child> --json commits -q '.commits | length')
   parent_tip=$(git -C "$wt" rev-parse "<branch>~$n")
   git -C "$wt" log --oneline "$parent_tip..<branch>"   # exactly the child's own commits?
   ```

   The count equals commits-since-fork only while the child's history is
   untouched — an amend or an earlier base retarget breaks it silently. If that
   log shows anything that is not the child's own work (or misses some of it),
   `$parent_tip` is the wrong SHA: STOP and read the fork point off
   `git log --oneline <branch>` instead.

   Then pick the form by asking **git**, not the API — see the first sharp edge
   for why the API cannot answer this:

   ```bash
   git -C "$wt" merge-base --is-ancestor "$parent_tip" origin/<base-branch> \
     && echo "plain rebase" || echo "rebase --onto"
   ```

   c. **Inspect the result**:
   ```bash
   git -C "$wt" log --oneline origin/<base-branch>..HEAD
   ```
   Every commit here should be this PR's own work. An unexplainable one (a
   cherry-pick from another worktree, a stray amend) is a STOP — see below.

   d. Run the project's own test command in `$wt` — confirm green. Detect it, never assume a
   toolchain: a `test` / `check` / `verify` recipe in `just --list`, else
   `scripts.test` in `package.json`, else a `test` target in the `Makefile`, else the
   language default (`bats tests/`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`). If none
   of these resolves, ask rather than guess — a skipped test suite reads exactly like
   a green one.

   e. Force-push with lease (refuses to clobber if upstream moved):
   ```bash
   git -C "$wt" push --force-with-lease
   ```

4. **Worktree cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```
   Remove a worktree with no uncommitted changes (`git -C <path> status
   --porcelain` empty) when **either** its branch no longer exists on origin (it
   was deleted post-merge), **or** it is one of the `/tmp/rebase-pr-*` temporaries
   step 3a added — those outlive their branch and step 4 is the only thing that
   collects them:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <path>          # refuses on untracked files; inspect,
                                       # then --force once you know what they are
   ```

   Then prune the branch itself. A merged PR leaves both copies behind. Delete a
   listed branch only when it has no open PR and no surviving worktree:
   ```bash
   def=$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | cut -d/ -f2-)
   # Enumerate from PR STATE, not `git branch --merged` — first sharp edge.
   list=$(mktemp)
   for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads |
              grep -vxE "<base-branch>|$def"); do
     st=$(gh pr list --state all --head "$b" \
            --json state -q '.[0].state' 2>/dev/null)
     [ "$st" = "MERGED" ] && echo "$b" >> "$list"   # MERGED only, never CLOSED
   done
   grep -qxE "<base-branch>|$def" "$list" && { echo "ABORT"; exit 1; }
   xargs -a "$list" -n1 git branch -D     # -d refuses a squash-merged branch
   git push origin --delete <branch>      # skip if the merge already deleted it
   ```

5. **Close the issues the merge did not** — this one is about the PR that just
   merged, not the rebased ones. GitHub honours `Closes #N` only when the PR's
   base is the repo's **default** branch, and it reads the *commit* message as
   well as the body. In a gitflow repo that splits the two cases: a keyword in
   the body of a `develop`-based PR does nothing and never will, because the
   release pull request does not inherit its constituents' bodies; a keyword in
   the *commit* message fires later, when the promotion pushes that commit to
   the default branch. So write the keyword into the commit message, and check
   what actually closed before closing anything by hand:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <n> --json closingIssuesReferences -q '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'
   ```

   Empty output means nothing has closed *yet*. Read the intent off the body,
   which is where the keywords were written:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <n> --json body -q .body |
     grep -oiE '(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?) #[0-9]+' |
     grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sort -u
   ```

   (A body naming the same issue twice would otherwise be closed twice.)

   Close each by hand, citing the merge commit so the trail survives:

   ```bash
   gh issue close <n> --comment "Fixed in #<pr>, merged to <branch> as <sha>."
   ```

   Skip this where the PR's base *is* the default branch: there the keywords
   fired already. Skip it too where the keyword went into the commit message and
   a promotion is due, because that one will close itself. One issue closed a
   second after its release merged, from the squash message of the pull request
   that fixed it.

6. **Re-snapshot PR statuses** — re-run step 2's `gh pr list`. GitHub computes
   `mergeable` asynchronously, so a query fired straight after the push answers
   `UNKNOWN`; wait and re-query rather than reporting that. Then report:

   ```
   PR #3: rebased onto develop, dropped 5 duplicate commits, CLEAN
   PR #4: rebased onto develop, dropped 2 duplicate commits, CLEAN
   PR #5: was already CLEAN, no action
   ```

## Sharp edges

- **`git branch --merged` cannot see a squash-merge.** A squash commit is not
  the commits it squashed, so a squash-merged branch is never an ancestor of the
  base: `--merged` omits it and `git branch -d` refuses it as unmerged. In a
  repo that squashes every feature PR — the common setup — that means the
  cleanup step silently does nothing, forever. Measured 2026-09-02 on one repo:
  **47 stale branches, every one with a MERGED PR, and `--merged` listed almost
  none of them.**

  The branch's own history cannot answer "was this merged". The PR can:

  ```bash
  gh pr list --state all --head "$b" --json state -q '.[0].state'
  ```

  Then `-D`, not `-d` — and only on `MERGED`, never on `CLOSED`, which means
  the work was abandoned rather than landed.

## When to STOP and ask

- The rebase empties the branch — every commit was a duplicate, so step 3c's log
  prints nothing. Do not force-push a zero-diff PR and call it CLEAN: the work is
  already on the base, so close the PR instead.
- A real conflict (not a duplicate-patch artefact) appears during rebase → don't auto-resolve; abort with `git rebase --abort` and ask the user.
- A rebase produces a commit on top that you can't explain (e.g. a cherry-pick from another local worktree) — surface it before pushing.
- Tests fail post-rebase → don't push; report the failure with the file:line.
- `--force-with-lease` is rejected → the remote moved, and fetching alone does
  not change that: your branch still lacks the new upstream commits, so a bare
  retry fails identically. Fetch, rebase onto the moved base, retry once. Still
  rejected means someone else is pushing that branch — stop and ask.

## Safety rules

- Never operate on `main` or `develop` directly — only on feature branches.
