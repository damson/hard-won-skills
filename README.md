👋 **Welcome!** This is a marketplace of **39 skills in 5 themed plugins**:
small, careful procedures your agent picks up automatically when a task calls
for them: rebasing a stack of PRs without losing one, proving a screenshot test
actually compared pixels, probing a migration without leaving a trace.

What holds them together is where they came from. **Every skill here was
extracted from a real session where not having it cost something**: a check
that could never fail, a release that could not tag itself, forty-seven stale
branches nobody could see. The measured facts stayed in the text, and so did
the scars: each skill knows not just what to do, but when to stop and ask.

## 🚀 Quick start

Two commands and you're in:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add damson/hard-won-skills
claude plugin install git-workflow@hard-won-skills --yes
```

Swap `git-workflow` for any plugin in [the table below](#-pick-your-themes),
and install as many as you like. Both commands are safe to re-run (idempotent, exit `0`), `--yes` is
only required when stdout is not a TTY, and `claude plugin update` re-fetches
just the plugins whose version moved.

**Then… do nothing.** You don't invoke a skill so much as walk into it: each
one declares the situations and phrases it fires on, and the agent picks it up
when your task matches: "rebase the open PRs", "do the baselines still pass",
a push to a branch with an open PR. Curious what you just installed? Every
skill has a README beside its procedure with its triggers and a worked
example; start with any link below.

## 🗂 Pick your themes

| Plugin | Skills | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| **[git-workflow](plugins/git-workflow/README.md)** | 16 | Branch, worktree and pull-request hygiene |
| **[agent-config](plugins/agent-config/README.md)** | 9 | Writing and auditing agent instruction files |
| **[verification](plugins/verification/README.md)** | 5 | Proving a check can fail before trusting it |
| **[data-safety](plugins/data-safety/README.md)** | 5 | Writes that are hard to undo |
| **[mobile-ui](plugins/mobile-ui/README.md)** | 4 | Android / Compose screenshots, Figma components, on-device checks |

Not sure where to begin? **[verification](#verification)** is five skills,
takes a minute to read, and changes how you look at every green checkmark
you'll ever see again. (And if you only ever install one plugin, that's the
one we'd hand you.)

### git-workflow

Rebase open PRs onto a base that has just merged, reply to review findings one
row per finding, prune dead branches and worktrees, embed a screenshot that
renders for reviewers on a private repo, report coverage as one sticky comment
with a threshold band rather than a fresh number every push, check a diagram
still matches the system before ticking "architecture updated", move a
vendored pin only with the evidence that earned the new commit, and wire a
scheduled workflow so its cron actually fires (GitHub registers schedule
triggers only from the default branch). Two more from one long launch session:
wait out a PR's checks at a pinned SHA where an empty conclusion counts as
pending, and land a batch of independent fixes as file-disjoint PRs built by
parallel agents whose scope fences hold. And one more: run a release to
completion rather than to the merge, since the tag, the floating tag and the
back-merge all fail without turning anything red. And the step every one of
those stops short of: press the merge button itself, once the go-ahead is
confirmed to still cover this pull request at this commit. And the one that
picks up where all of them end: the `on: push` run the merge starts, which is
the first and only exercise of merge-time credentials, and where "nothing ran"
and "nothing was supposed to run" look identical afterwards. And one for the
tree itself rather than its history: uncommitted changes in a checkout more than
one writer touches, where discarding destroys work nobody can recover and
committing everything lands somebody's half-written draft under your name.

### agent-config

Audit a `CLAUDE.md` stack for contradictions and duplication, keep a config file
a pointer rather than a copy of its sibling, notice when a repeated instruction
should become a skill, validate a skill against a real project before trusting
it, capture a long session's learnings before compacting, and turn a finding
about one page into a checked answer about every page like it.

### verification

Five skills for one failure: trusting something nobody has checked. One makes
you break the thing on purpose and watch the check go red; one runs that loop
over a batch of guards, where a filter selecting nothing and a mutation changing
nothing both read as a pass; one makes you run a dependency and observe its
behaviour instead of asserting what its naming implies; one is for the moment a
signal and reality disagree, and sends you to the authoritative record before
you debug work that was never broken; and the last points the same discipline at
a sentence, when a layout requirement has round-tripped twice and another
paragraph will only be misread the same way.

### data-safety

Probe a migration inside a transaction and roll it back, interrogating it as
each role that will meet it. Answer data questions with a throwaway read-only
probe instead of a remembered number. Make a bulk write reversible before
running it.
Catch the Supabase-managed-schema traps that pass review and fail in production.
Sweep a repository's full history and its remote before anything goes public.

### mobile-ui

Record and verify Compose screenshot baselines, including the silent no-op where
the task reports `PASSED` while comparing no pixels at all. Build a Compose
component from a Figma node, bound to design tokens rather than raw values. And
where no test can hold the claim, drive the change on a real device without
trusting a stale frame or a tap that missed.

## 🧬 What a skill here looks like

Every skill is two files:

- **`SKILL.md`**, the procedure the agent follows: frontmatter whose `name`
  matches its folder, a `## Procedure`, and a **`## When to STOP`** section.
  That last one is the part most skill collections leave out, and it is what
  stops a skill firing on a task it should decline: the difference between a
  procedure and a hazard.
- **`README.md`**, the half written for you: what the skill produces, the
  phrases that reach it, a worked example, and the sibling skills it hands
  off to.

Skills are written to be **portable**: none names a path from the repo it came
from, or assumes a folder layout. Where one can take advantage of tooling you
may not have, it says so and degrades instead of failing.

## 🔬 The harness behind these skills

These were extracted while building
**[agent-config-harness](https://github.com/damson/agent-config-harness)**:
agent instruction files, scored and regression-tested like code. If this
marketplace is the habits, that repo is the bench they were measured on, and
`scripts/validate-skills.sh` here is vendored straight from it.

It asks the question a `CLAUDE.md` rarely gets asked: when did you last measure
it? Config files are graded one to five on clarity, conciseness, completeness,
consistency and actionability, out of 25 with a letter grade and named
findings, recorded per domain over time so an improvement is distinguishable
from a rewrite that merely felt productive. A `bats` suite covers the
structural invariants a rubric cannot see, including the skill layout this
marketplace's own CI enforces.

It is also a GitHub Action, so a build fails when config quality slips below a
grade you choose:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: damson/agent-config-harness@v1
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  with:
    files: CLAUDE.md
    fail-below: C
```

Seeing what a grade looks like costs no API key: two real eval runs ship in the
repo, the same config one edit apart, 24/25 and 13/25.

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a rough edge? That's exactly the kind of thing this repo is made of: a
skill that stopped matching its tool's current behaviour is a bug worth
reporting even without a fix, and small contributions count: a clearer worked
example, a sharper trigger, a STOP case you hit in the wild. The bar for a
new skill is the lineage above: it encodes something that actually went wrong
and would go wrong again.

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the complete guide**: ways to
contribute, what a skill ships as, the three validators to run before pushing,
and the conventions they cannot see.

## 📦 Releases

`develop` integrates, `main` is what `claude plugin marketplace add` installs.
A workflow promotes one to the other every three days, but only when there is
something to promote and the CI suite passes: plugins that changed get a patch
bump, the marketplace gets a CalVer tag. Gates, couplings and how to hold a
release: [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md).
